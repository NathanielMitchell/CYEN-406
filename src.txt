4 c chicken broth
2 c water
1 white onion
0.25 c carrots, coarsely chopped
0.25 celery stalk, coarsely chopped
0.5 t salt
1 c vegetable oil
1 c milk
1 c all-purpose flour
6 medium mushrooms, thinly sliced
4 green onions, diced
Combine the chicken broth and water in a large saucepan over high heat. Cut the white onion in half, then coarsely chop
one half. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, and salt to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for
about 10 m or until the onions start to become translucent. As the broth simmers, heat the vegetable oil in a small
saucepan over medium heat. Slice the remaining onion into very thin slices. Separate the slices, dip them into the milk
then into the flour. Fry the breaded onions, a handful at a time, until golden brown. Drain on a paper towel. When the
soup has simmered, strain the vegetables and toss them out. Pour the broth back into the pan and keep it hot over low
heat. Add salt (to taste). To serve, ladle the broth into a bowl, add a few pieces of the fried onion, a few mushroom slices,
and sprinkle with diced green onion.
